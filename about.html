  <div class="aboutme">
    <p>  My name is Kyle Ferguson </p>
  <p> I am a graduate of the Algonquin College Computer Programming Diploma with Presidents Honors Roll. However, My coding journey did not begin there.</p>
  <p>I have always had an interest in all things tech, from my first gameboy and beyond</p>
  <p>As a child, I was creating websites for my band using Dreamweaver mixing drag and drop with some HTML editing</p>
  <p>In 2019, I began FreeCodeCamp which introduced me to HTML, CSS and JavaScript</p>
  <p>As this became stale, I ventured to The Odin Project</p>
  <p>Throughout the projects I have completed, I have gained an extensive understanding of JavaScript, Data Structures and Algorithms.</p>
  <p>I then continued to work through CS50, where I was introduced to C as well as Python </p>
  <p>From here, I applied to Algonquin in 2023, where I pursed the Computer Programming Diploma.</p>
  <p>This has given me experience in Java, both with Android applications, web applications and plain Java Code</p>
  <p>A large focus of my studies have been on design patterns in Java, which I continue to apply and hone</p>
  <p>I continue to pursue the Odin Project until completetion, and then to see where things take me.</p>
  <p>I have a hunger for coding, and find myself feeling a rush, some notable moments are when I figured out merge sort, or BST algorithms and finally having recursion 'click'</p>
