    <p class="aboutmetext">My name is Kyle Ferguson. I am a graduate of the Algonquin College Computer Programming Diploma with Presidents Honors Roll 
      
    <br> <br>However, my coding journey did not begin there. 
    
    <br><br> I have always had an interest in all things tech, from my first Gameboy and beyond. 
    
    <br><br> As a child, I was creating websites for my band using Dreamweaver, mixing drag and drop with some HTML editing. 
    
    <br><br> In 2019, I began FreeCodeCamp, which introduced me to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As this became stale, I ventured to The Odin Project. 
    
    <br><br> Throughout the projects I have completed, I have gained an extensive understanding of JavaScript, Data Structures, and Algorithms. 

    <br><br> I then continued to work through CS50, where I was introduced to C as well as Python and SQL. <br><br>
    
    From here, I applied to Algonquin in 2023, where I pursued the Computer Programming Diploma. <br> This has given me experience in Java, both with Android applications, web applications, and plain Java code. 
    
    <br><br>A large focus of my studies has been on design patterns in Java, which I continue to apply and hone. 
    
    <br><br> I continue to pursue the Odin Project until completion, and then see where things take me. I have a hunger for coding and find myself feeling a rush. 
    
    <br><br>Some notable moments are when I figured out merge sort, or BST algorithms, and finally having recursion 'click'.</p>
